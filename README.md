Why the web dev when sales pays the bills?!

Sales and business is great--give it a try at least for 5 years and see the difference on how you see the world and how you see yourself. But never allows you to become an architect. Life is short, life provides myriads of opportunities. Focus is necessary. After months (and even years) of questioning
Masters Degree in Process Engineering (Petrochem, Waste-to-energy, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Energy and Process Systems Engineering).
Sales to learn the trade skills
Programming to create further leverage.
Family to come (hoping it will be very soon)
Web dev is closely connected to people, closer than we have ever imagined. I love people, interact with them, but people in Sales lack the tools. Or lack the skills to improve their skills. Such is my story. I come from inneficient life of sales engineer who decided to do better tools in VBA and SQL within Microsoft to speed up the quotation process by 90-95%..but quoting is not the only thing, we needed to configure our products--there I was not allowed to contribute. I do not like being held in impression that something cannot be done. I did not know how to code in VBA and SQL and learnt it to get my life and my colleagues' lives better and easier too. Everything is possible, it just takes time to cover the complexity.

Let's get to work and post to github as often as my girlfriend allows me  ::))
